    The design process behind this project was a difficult one, brought on by the 48-hour time constraints of the game jam. In the first 12 hours I had scope creeped myself to death and needed to ground myself in a project which I could complete within the time. For this I reused a card draw system I had begun for a Slay the Spire remake. This became the card system in the finished game once I had stripped away the mana costs. This system uses scriptable objects to quickly iterate and build cards. By the end I could create a card scriptable object, add its stats and effects via the Unity Inspector, and add it into the shop rotation.

    One of the main things I learned from this jam, as I did from the previous was the importance of testing. It took me 90% of the time allotted to complete the mechanics, and add content so when it came to polishing, the bugs were endless. So endless were the bugs that I managed to break the entire game an hour before the deadline via a rogue while loop, and unfortunate planning. Next time I participate in a game jam I will be sure to get a completed gameplay loop by the halfway point so the remainder can be utilised for polishing and content.
